# WeatherTweaks

### Working with experimental LLL version!

A few tweaks to the weather system.

Currently, vanilla weather system is completely random - it means that weather condition can exists for few days in a row, which makes it _not very fun_ to play - this mod aims to fix that.

This mod fully fixes any weather desyncs happening in the game.

For more information check [the wiki](https://github.com/AndreyMrovol/LethalWeatherTweaks/wiki).

### Supported versions

WeatherTweaks supports game versions v49 and v50.
Works on vanilla, with LLL (1.1.6) and experimental LLL (1.2.0)

## Experimental version

WeatherTweaks has a [beta version branch](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/mrov/BetaWeatherTweaksBeta/) that expands on the stable version with combined weather conditions, **weathers changing during the day** and many more!
