# WeatherTweaks

Simple mod that adds a few difficulty tweaks to the weather system.

Currently, vanilla weather system is completely random - it means that weather condition can exists for few days in a row, which makes it _not fun_ to play - this mod aims to fix that.

## Features

- Weathers on a new save try to mimic default vanilla behavior, which didn't happen with any modded moons present
- Uncertain weather mechanic: shown forecast won't always be 100% accurate
- (optional) Difficulty scaling with player amount and quotas completed
- (optional) No certain weather conditions shown mode
- (optional) Always unknown weather mode
- Combined weathers: the ability for multiple weather conditions to be present at the same time
- Progressing weathers: the ability for weather conditions to change during the day

## Conditions

Weather calculation operates based on weights defined in the config file.
