# WeatherTweaks

Simple mod that adds a few tweaks to the weather system.

Currently, vanilla weather system is completely random - it means that weather condition can exists for few days in a row, which makes it _not very fun_ to play - this mod aims to fix that.

## Features

- More advanced weather picking system
- Fully synchronized weather between host and clients
- Config file with weighted system
- Fully configurable
- Weathers on a new save try to mimic default vanilla behavior, which didn't happen with any modded moons present

## Conditions

Weather calculation operates with weights defined in the config file.

## To-do

- config file
- ability to work with vanilla clients
- additional parameters:
  - chance for eclipse based on game's length
  - crew daysInRow
